# dotfiles

All of my dotfiles

1. **Neovim**: My Neovim config honestly probably needs some cleanup, especially given that [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) has changed their setup. However, I do use this daily, and so a backup is nice.
2. **Hyprland**: My current WM. Relies on [Hyprnvidia](https://github.com/rgarber11/small_scripts/tree/master/hyprnvidia) for Optimus, and calls into scripts in the [nwg_panel folder](repo/master/nwg_panel/executors/keyboard_layout.py). Also uses `nwg-panel`, `nwg-dock-hyprland`, `anyrun`, `hypridle`, `hyprlock`, etc. Beyond that, I think these are some pretty sane defaults.
3. **Nwg-Panel**: Few changes here, aside from executors for keyboard layout, allowing for keyboard shortcuts to change the layout, and icons for numlock and capslock.
4. **NWG-Dock-Hyprland**, **Anyrun**: Mostly cosmetic changes to make them _solarized_
